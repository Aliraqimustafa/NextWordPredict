# NextWordPredict

Welcome here! This repo is for a next word prediction project using NGram technology. To train your model, follow these steps:

1. Upload your data.
2. Open the `main.py` file.
3. Set the path of your text file in the `main.py` code.

If you want to use the `main.py` code as-is, you'll need to install the `datasets` library. Here's how:

```bash
pip install datasets
